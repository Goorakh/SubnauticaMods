# Gorakh's Subnautica Mods

A repository for my Subnautica mods, if you want to build these for some godforsaken reason:
* Add game assembly references (paths will most likely be incorrect)
* Install required NuGet package(s)
* Add a `GamePath.txt` file in the root directory (ex `X:\Git\SubnauticaMods\GamePath.txt`) containing the absolute path to your Subnautica directory (ending `\` included!)
* Enjoy(?)
