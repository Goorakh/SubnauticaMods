Not done:
	Make a config tool instead of making users edit json files (possibly in-game? SMLHelper is great but unfortunately doesn't seem to have all the functionaliy needed)
	Make randomization seed-based, save seed in the save slots, read it back upon loading, also give users the option to specify a seed when starting a new game
	Rework creature randomizer to hook the deserialization process instead of Creature.Start
	Figure out a better structure for ColorRandomizer instead of patching 500 different methods
	Randomize crashfish powder
	Randomize gas pods
	Replace creepvine seed cluster model
	Replace table coral chunk models to match replaced item

Done/Ready to test:
	Correct some recipes when resources are randomized (creepvine seed cluster, things from outcrops, seeds, etc), make sure this is compatible with recipe randomizers
	Coffee vending machines don't drop properly, they get placed in the world with no way for the player to pick it up
	Replace ghost model when titanium (and other resources) are being constructed in the fabricator
