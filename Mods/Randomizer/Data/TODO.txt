Not done:
	Make a config tool instead of making users edit json files (possibly in-game? SML is great but unfortunately doesn't seem to have all the functionaliy needed)
	Make randomization seed-based, save seed in the save slots, read it back upon loading, also give users the option to specify a seed when starting a new game
	Rework creature randomizer to hook the deserialization process instead of Creature.Start

Done/Ready to test:
	Correct some recipes when resources are randomized (creepvine seed cluster, things from outcrops, seeds, etc), make sure this is compatible with recipe randomizers
