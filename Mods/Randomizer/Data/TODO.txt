Not done:
	Make a config tool instead of making users edit json files (possibly in-game? SMLHelper is great but unfortunately doesn't seem to have all the functionaliy needed)
	Make randomization seed-based, save seed in the save slots, read it back upon loading, also give users the option to specify a seed when starting a new game
	Rework creature randomizer to hook the deserialization process instead of Creature.Start
	Randomize crashfish powder
	Replace creepvine seed cluster model
	Replace table coral chunk models to match replaced item
	Randomzie fire extinguisher smoke effects (Generic particle system color randomizer?)

Done/Ready to test:
	Figure out a better structure for ColorRandomizer instead of patching 500 different methods
	Randomize gas pods
	Replace encyclopedia text for replaced audio logs (replace with override line subtitle)
	Randomize color of scanning effect
