Not done:
	Make a config tool instead of making users edit json files (possibly in-game? SMLHelper is great but unfortunately doesn't seem to have all the functionaliy needed)
	Make randomization seed-based, save seed in the save slots, read it back upon loading, also give users the option to specify a seed when starting a new game
		Save LootRandomizer replacement dictionary
		Save randomized item sizes
		Save most of everything else while I'm at it?
	Fix lifepod location randomizer spawning player inside the Aurora (& radiation zone)
	Rework creature randomizer to hook the deserialization process instead of Creature.Start
	Randomize crashfish powder
	Replace creepvine seed cluster model
	Replace table coral chunk models to match replaced item
	Lifepod Randomizer:
		Figure out how to handle the case of your vehicle getting destroyed.
			Repair it slowly overtime?
			Make it invincible?
		Add a minimum depth check for big models (cyclops & rocket) to avoid clipping into terrain

Done/Ready to test:
	Randomize gas pods
