Hello! Thank you for downloading the GRandomizer.

# Features: #
- Spawn location randomizer:
	Randomizes lifepod spawn location when creating a new save.
	Configurable via an 'intensity' slider
- Item craft duration randomizer:
	Randomizes item craft times
- Localization randomizer:

- Item size randomizer:
	Randomizes how much space items take up in your inventory and storage containers
- Color randomizer:
	Randomizes biome light settings, day/night-cycle light & skybox settings, most UI colors, and a lot of other miscellaneous colors I can't be bothered to list.
- Creature randomizer:
	Randomizes creature spawns. Currently very basic, will be expanded and improved upon in future versions.
- Dialogue randomizer:
	Randomizes all in-game dialogue, can be configured to either be completely random or keeping the same speaker

Due to this being the first ever public release, do not expect anything close to being finished, it is still a big work in progress.
